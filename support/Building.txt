wxGo doesn't work out of the box after a simple 'go get github.com/Lomanic/wxGo' or 
'go install github.com\Lomanic\wxGo', it needs to be compiled using SWIG.

The following is needed for building wxGo on Windows.
- MinGW (Go does not support the Cygwin toolchain according to this doc:
http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/InstallFromSource#Install_C_tools)

- wxWidgets (version 2.8.11.0 or version close to it.)

- SWIG

Download and install wxPack which comes with the pre-compiled wxWidgets libraries.
https://github.com/rjpcomputing/wxpack/wiki

Download the latest SWIG version from www.swig.org. SWIG now supports Go so you don't 
have to build it from source.
http://www.swig.org/download.html

Don't forget to add the binaries from SWIG and MinGW to your %PATH% environment 
variable (for me it was C:\swigwin-2.0.10 and C:\MinGW\bin)


Copy Make.pkg from your %GOPATH%\github.com\Lomanic\wxGo to your 
%GOROOT%\src folder. If you don't have in this directory  Make.common or 
Make.inc, download them from this github: https://github.com/niemeyer/golang/tree/master/src

Copy  dlimpexp.h and version.h from your wxWidgetsDirectory\include\wx to 
%GOPATH%\github.com\Lomanic\wxGo\wx\wx (no, this is not a typo, there is a sub-directory 
called 'wx' in the wx directory).

I had to add %GOROOT%\pkg\tool\windows_386 to my %PATH% (this folder includes 8c.exe, 8g.exe...).

Copy cgocall.h and runtime.h from %GOROOT%\src\pkg\runtime to %GOPATH%\src\github.com\JeroenD\wxGo\wx\_obj

If you got this far then you are almost there.

To build the wxGo library:
cd %GOPATH%\github.com\Lomanic\wxGo\wx
mingw32-make install

To build the examples apps just go to the relevant directories and type make.
